## Introduction
 Train Seat Reservation/ticket booking system is one of the services which is in high demand in the current scenario. Online booking of seats is much safer than going to the station and booking in person. Moreover, going digital has made the scope of this system is quite high. Everyone is being encouraged to go online as much as possible. So, this utility would help people book tickets online from wherever they are and whenever they want.

## Research

As of 2018, 82% of all travel bookings were made online through travel sites and mobile apps. This statistic shows that there is a scope of business in this system.  
## Cost and Features
This is a simple prototype of the system and therefore does not cost anything. If we build on this model/system and make it suitable for business, then there would be costs incurring due to the different features required like UI/UX design, Cyber Security, DBMS etc.
